The technology works great. The sound is really good The device hears your voice and responds. Looking at the transcript it understands nearly everything I say. But it does not understand. The device is not made for fun. It is for sales. I had expected a SIRI type of assistant. Not even close. It does not understand 90% of the things I asked it to do... Web searches - no. News... only the things they want you to hear. I can use pandora and that works well. If wou want a device that will remind you what you want to order from Amazon you probabally can't find any better tool. But, to do simle quick inquiries on the web, current news stories read to you , to send a message to someone....It doesn't do that. I love good technology, I love toys and gadgets... I ended up with a voice controlled Pandora player that wants me to order books and music and products from Amazon.
